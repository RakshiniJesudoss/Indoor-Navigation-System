# Indoor-Navigation-System
This system helps people navigate inside a building by providing turn-by-turn directions. This project holds data exclusively for Loyola ICAM College of Engineering and Tecchnology, India.

# Overview
A Smartphone collects radio signals, geomagnetic fields, inertial sensor data, barometric pressure, camera data and other sensory information to provide navigation inside a building. This application makes use of Indoor Positioning System which aims at navigating and tracking objects inside the building using the IndoorAtlas SDK, which works on the theory of Hybrid Indoor Positioning Technology. Google Maps plays a very crucial role in this project. Its Android API helps us display maps in the screen. We are able to align the floor plan to the exact coordinates of the building and is fetched from cloud and overlayed on the google maps.
